Karan Pardhan – Editor | Freelancer | YouTuber

Welcome to the official portfolio of Karan Pardhan, a passionate video editor and creative freelancer with a strong background in cinematic storytelling. I've had the privilege of working with major educational brands like Physics Wallah, production studios like G2V, and some of the most inspiring names in Indian MMA and athletics — including Anshul Jubli, Puja Tomar, Pawan Maan, Sumit Kumar, Shaymanad, and Rudar Rana Partap.

Whether it's shaping powerful narratives, editing high-impact reels, or producing full-length cinematic documentaries for YouTube, my mission is to turn raw footage into unforgettable stories.

Let the visuals speak. Let the story breathe.
